## Overview

The MNIST dataset contains 8x8 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9) and their labels. This project uses the SVM algorithm with an RBF kernel to classify these digits effectively. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardization of pixel values for optimal SVM performance.
- **Model Training**: Uses an SVM with the RBF kernel and hyperparameters tuned for the MNIST dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Includes accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix visualization.
- **Visualization**:
  - Sample images from the dataset.
  - Predicted vs. true labels on test samples.
  - Confusion matrix for a detailed error analysis.
